There will be a clickable icon here, at the end, to start the application execution.

The Database folder actually contains cheese photos related to the model training.
It can be also used for user-related information if the need arises.

Server folder contains the model and project-related functionality.

User folder will have all the app user interfaces.

I recommend using pycharm for the project.
